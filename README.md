Basic description about our topic:

By mapping crime hotspots and color-coding them according to variables like time and kind, this study seeks to improve public safety. Using social, economic, and seasonal data, it forecasts crime trends to support proactive policing through automated route creation. By identifying accident-prone regions and streamlining patrol routes using iRAD and CCTNS data, the project also increases the protection of women.
